The red line is the aggregated data for all 20 traits on the original (untransformed) scale. The intensity of the colors are proportional to the ranking of the PC or pPC axes, stronger lines represent the first axes. When the leading eigenvector explains very little variation in the data and the effective dimensionality is high, the slope of node height test increases from negative to positive across PC axes. This indicates that under standard PCA, PC1 has higher contrasts near the root of the tree, while later PCs have higher contrasts near the tips (resulting in the pattern of model support observed in Figure 1\hbox {}). As the amount of variance explained by the principal eigenvector increases, the slope of the node height test approaches 0. No such effect is found for phylogenetic PCA.\relax }}{24}}

Contrasts were calculated for each of the 20 traits corresponding to either PC scores (top row) or pPPC scores (bottom row). Each line represents a best--fit linear model to the aggregated data across all 100 replicate simulations. Red lines are aggregated over all 20 traits on the original data. The plots are oriented so that the left side of each panel corresponds to the root of the phylogeny, with time increasing tipward to the right. The intensity of the colors are proportional to the ranking of the PC or pPC axes, stronger lines represent the first axes. PCA results in a predictable pattern of increasing slope in the contrasts across PCs. By contrast, pPCA only has systematic distortions across pPC axes when the underlying model is not multivariate BM. When this occurs, the first few pPC axes tend to have more extreme slopes than the original data (but in the correct direction).\relax }}{26}}

The datasets were simulated under BM (left), OU (middle) or EB (right). The analyses were then performed on PC scores (top row) and pPPC scores (bottom row).

We fit a loess curve through the relative disparities for each trait/transformation/model combination. The plots are oriented so that the left side of each panel corresponds to the root of the phylogeny, with time increasing tipward to the right. The intensity of the colors are proportional to the ranking of the PC or pPC axes, stronger lines represent the first axes. As in Fig. 4\hbox {}, the first few axes from the PCA show a strong pattern of high disparity early in the clades' histories with the higher components showing seemingly higher disparity towards the present. PPCA corrects the distortion if the generating model is multivariate BM. However, if the generating model was not BM, the first few pPC axes tend to show an exaggerated pattern of disparity relative to the original traits.\relax }}{27}}
